Easily create organized documentation for multiple products, organized by product and by subsections within each product.

== Description ==

Create documentation for multiple items, for example, for multiple software products. This is for you if you need to create documentation for multiple products, and must have the docs organized neatly, by product. The main "Docs Page" will list all the products. Clicking on a product will take you to the docs only for that product.

Each product's docs is further organized into subsections. The subsections list each individual article in that docs section. 

The single docs posts will have a Docs Table of Contents widget added to the sidebar (only if your theme has a dynamic sidebar). This will show a nice Table of Contents for docs pertaining only to the product which this current single doc belongs to.
