Easily create organized documentation for multiple products, organized by product and by subsections within each product.

== Description ==

Create documentation for any number of products, organized by product, and by sub-headings within each product. You can use this to create instruction guides for just about anything.

This is for you if any of these apply:

* You need to create software documentation.
* You need to create documentation for one or multiple products, and must have the docs organized neatly, by product. 
* You need to write instruction guides for virtually anything, whether it be products, games, topics, etc. You can label them as "Instructions" instead of "Docs".
* You don't want to create a separate website for your docs. You simply want to add them on to your current WordPress site.

**Built-in SEO**

Documentation articles will have schema.org microdata. It adds **TechArticle** microdata to single Docs, and **CollectionPage** microdata to Docs archives. You can disable the microdata.

**Documentation With a User-Friendly Structure For Your Visitors**

The main "Docs Page" will list all the products. Clicking on a product will take you to the docs only for that product.

Each product's docs are organized into subsections. The subsections list each individual article in that docs section. 

A single docs post will have a Table of Contents widget added to the sidebar. This will show a Table of Contents for docs pertaining only to the product which this current single doc belongs to. 

Organized Docs works on **Multisite** WordPress installations, as well as regular WordPress sites.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the layout all messed up? = 

The Organized Docs layout is compatible with these default WordPress themes: Twenty Fifteen, Twenty Fourteen, Twenty Thirteen, and Twenty Twelve.

On other themes, the layout may look all messed up. Itâ€™s very easy to fix this by copying the template files into your theme. Once you have copied them, make the necessary changes to the HTML to make it match your own theme, while leaving the important Organized Docs loop stuff intact.

See how to [Customize The Docs Template Files](http://isabelcastillo.com/docs/customize-the-docs-template-files).

= Where do I see the Docs on the front end? =

Visit your website at `www.your-webiste.com/docs/` to see your Docs. Alternatively, add individual Doc products (categories) to your Menu in your dashboard --> Appearance --> Menus. This last method is better for you if you are only documenting one product on the site (rather than multiple products).


= Why does the Table of Contents widget appear multiple times on the same page? =

This is no longer an issue since version 2.0.
